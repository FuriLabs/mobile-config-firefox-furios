## Default Preferences

### browser.urlbar.suggest.topsites

* Value: false
* Description: ...
* Reason: Do not suggest facebook, ebay, reddit etc. in the urlbar. Same as
  Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Address Bar -> Shortcuts. As side-effect, the
  urlbar results are not immediatelly opened once clicking the urlbar.

### browser.urlbar.suggest.engines

* Value: false
* Description: ...
* Reason: Do not suggest search engines. Even though amazon is removed via
  policies.json, it gets installed shortly after the browser is opened. With this
  option, at least there is no big "Search with Amazon" message in the urlbar
  results as soon as typing the letter "a".

### media.webrtc.camera.allow-pipewire

* Value: true
* Description: ...
* Reason: FF >= 116 allows to use cameras via Pipewire. While it will likely
  still take a while until this is made the default, on most mobile devices it
  makes a lot of sense to enable it unconditionally, as cameras usually only work
  with libcamera, not via plain v4l2.

### dom.maxtouchpoints.testing.value

* Value: 1
* Description: ...
* Reason: Make navigator.maxTouchPoints return 1 for clients to determine this is
  a touch device. This is the same value used by Web Developer Tools > Responsive
  Design Mode > Enable touch simulation.

### browser.urlbar.trimHttps

* Value: true
* Description: ...
* Reason: Hide https:// in urlbar by default to save space and make more relevant
  parts of the urlbar visible.

### widget.use-xdg-desktop-portal.file-picker

* Value: 1
* Description: ...
* Reason: Use the xdg-desktop-portal.file-picker by default, e.g., for a native
  file-picker instead of gtk-file-picker on Plasma Mobile.

### dom.w3c.touch_events.enabled

### apz.allow_zooming

### defaultPref('dom.w3c_touch_events.legacy_apis.enabled

* Value: true

  mobile compatibility and Firefox on Android behaves the same way.
